<p class="about">One of my hobbies is playing board games. I enjoy the frinedly competition that board games can bring some of my most cherished momments come from playing board games and of course as is mandatory to board games, an argument breaks out and calling your friend with a cuss word is a tradition at this point. Although I enjoy many different board games I have a favorite one and it is called "Carcassonne" and it was this game that got me into board games in the first place. One thing I should mention is the photo of me in the red tie, this picture was made into a card for a "Mafia" type game by me and my friends.</p>
<p class="about">Another one of my hobbies is writing, be it poems, or stories it is something truly amazing what a person can create what types of worlds he draw with words, what creatures and beasts roam upon it and what drives his story onward and creates and entirely new universe out of nothing. I love reading other people's work as much as I enjoy writing, so if you have written something I would be delighted to read on what adventure you send your readers, what perils and thrills one can experience from your story.</p>
