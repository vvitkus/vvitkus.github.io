<p class="about">My name is Vytautas Vitkus, I am a second year student from Lithuania. I'm majoring in contemporary communication and am planning to get my masters degree after I finish my bachelor's degree. 
One quick fact about me is that I was not born in Lithuania, but rather moved here from Kazakhstan. If you want to know my interests head over to the hobbies page to learn more!
P.S: The photo you see here is me in traditional Lituanian clothes and if you want to know a bit more about this, well you're going to have to ask me personally.</p>
